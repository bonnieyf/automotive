    h2.title EVHC
    p.txt On average $35 gets added to the average customer retail invoice every time a EVHC is performed on a vehicle. So it's no surprise that vehicle manufacturers and their dealer network will want to perform a multi-point inspection of the vehicle, while the Technician has the vehicle on the ramp and the wheels off. Dialyzing the process ensures no points are missed and customers are kept up to date in realtime. Increasing conversion rates of red and amber identified items by as much as 70%.

    h2.title Challenge
    p.txt Once the vehicle is on the ramp, the technician should carry out a thorough multi-point inspection every time. This is traditionally done on a paper check-sheet, with any identified items logged and updated to the DMS. Though doing it on paper means the technician can skip the full inspection and only check the items they wish to. It's a time consuming process, without transparency for the customer as there is no image or video capability.
